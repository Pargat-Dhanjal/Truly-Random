# Truly Random
Random numbers are the lifeblood of various applications, from simulating real-world phenomena to safeguarding communication in cryptography.

The Flaw in the Familiar: Traditional methods like Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) play a crucial role, but they suffer from a critical limitation: predictability.  Given the same starting point, they always produce the same sequence. Breaking Free from Determinism: This project seeks a solution beyond PRNGs. We aim to develop a novel approach for generating truly random numbers, defying predictability for enhanced security and reliability.
